 * Voice rules (per Samina):
 *   • First person ("I help...") — warm, conversational, never self-claiming
 *     or boastful. No "the best", "elite", "luxury", "exclusive".
 *   • Show luxury through restraint, never by saying it.
 *   • Avoid: hustle, grind, hot deals, let's get it.
 *   • Never call the Path to Ownership program "rent-to-own" or
 *     "credit repair" — both are different (and risky) categories.
 *   • Don't mention years licensed.
 *   • Don't mention Washington D.C. — service area is Virginia & Maryland only.
 *   • IT background — keep very subtle if at all.
